# Trie

A trie(from re**trie**val) is a search tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the elements/keys are strings.
Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node.
Instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.

In this example, the trie is used in the context of a dictionary, where each word appears once.
Words can be added, removed and searched, and the longest common prefix of a given word with any word in the list can be returned.
