A trie(from reTRIEval) is a search tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the elements/keys are strings.
Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node.
Instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.

*In this example, the trie is used in the context of a dictionary, where each word appears once.
Words can be added, removed and searched.
