A segment tree(statistic tree) is a tree data structure used for storing information about segments or intervals.
It is a structure that cannot be modified once it's built, and it is used for querying certain intervals.
-in this project, it is fully templated(can hold any object) and it receives a relation(bool function) that dictates
what the tree keeps track of.
