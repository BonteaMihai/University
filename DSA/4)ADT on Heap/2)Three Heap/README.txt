A heap is a hybrid between a dynamic array and a tree, as its elements are stored in a dynamic array
but it can be viewed as a tree. It can be used as an efficient representation for the priority queue.
In this example, the heap is organized by a relation given by the user.
In a three heap a node has at most three children.
